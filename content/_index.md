        I have complted my MSc in Media Computer Science from Saarland University, Germany. I was junior researcher at August-Wilhelm Scheer Institute. I worked on my master thesis at Max Planck Institute for Informatics.

        My research interests span in the broad areas of 3D-Reconstruction, Neural Rendering, Radiance Field Methods, Novel View Synthesis, Motion Capture, Scene Understanding, Scene Interaction, LLMs, VLMs, Digital Twins, AR/VR, and generally (3D) Computer Vision, GenAI, XR, HCI, Data Science, and Deep/Machine Learning, to solve complex problems with impactful AI-driven solutions.
