abstract: 'Cloud computing has a great potential to enhance productivity and reduce costs , hence many users are preferring it over various traditional technologies, but at the same time it gives rise to many security risks and challenges such as theft of data , data leakage and denial of service. Hence using single cloud is becoming obnoxious and the concept of multi-cloud is gaining popularity. This paper demonstrates use of DNA based cryptography to ensure secure data storage on multi-cloud. Keywords-DNA Sequence, DNA Base pairing rule, Cloud computing, Multi-cloud Architecture. I. INTRODUCTION Cloud computing is gaining immense popularity but has many security risks and challenges associated with it. Due to service availability failure risks and possibilities of malicious attack, use of single cloud is becoming less likely favoured. Upcoming solutions include multi-cloud technology. By dividing the data block into parts and distributing them among the various cloud service provider (CSP), better security aspects can be achieved. Each divided parts can be further protected by utilizing interesting features of DNA sequences. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a long polymer made from nucleotides. The double helix structure of DNA was first discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick. The DNA structures comprises of two helical chains. This helical structure contains four nucleotides namely Purine Adenine (A), Pyrimidine Thymine (T), Pyrimidine Cytosine (C), Purine Guanine (G). Watson-Crick Base Pairing Rules: To convert binary data into nucleotides as a DNA sequence, the base pairing rules are used. Synthesizing nucleotides naturally is done by constant rules: • Purine Adenine (A) always pairs with the pyrimidine Thymine (T). • Pyrimidine Cytosine (C) always pairs with the purine Guanine (G).'
